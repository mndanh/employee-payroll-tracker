# Employee Payroll Tracker

for this assignment I had to leverage JavaScript to enable a payroll manager to allow users to input their first name, last name, and salary. This would aggregate a table of employee data about their salary. I needed to make the payroll manager allow the user to continually input names and salary until they were finished. I also needed it to be able to tell the average salary and pick a random employee in the console.
